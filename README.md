# Controlling Media using Hand Gestures
This project is a small level attempt to see that how current smart TV's and latest technology works.
Therefore, I created this project myself to control our media screen using hand gestures. With the minimal functionality provided this project still works great.
This project uses Multi-layer Convolutional Neural Networks and some image processing which allows the system's webcam to capture the movement and gesture of the human hand and execute commands accordingly.
